Broken down into 3 separate packages, we each took one package to work on it.

First package: We were required to create two classes to query the Country table in our database. 
The classes should display information of countries that have a LifeExpectancy between two values using a prepared statement.

Second package: Creating the AnySQL class, this class allows users to input SQL commands from the 
console and execute them using the JDBC API

Third package: We created three classes to run SQL statements for inserting, updating, and deleting data
from the Country table. 

Using GitHub, we were able to work together and share the code across each other. However we were using local databases to get the data.
